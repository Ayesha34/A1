# Assignment 1 - Todo List Backend

In this first assignment, you will write a backend to service a cloud-based todo list app.  In this day and age, cloud-based products for viewing and saving various forms of content ([photos](https://photos.google.com/), [bookmarks](https://stash.ai/), [todo lists](https://en.todoist.com/), etc.) are becoming increasingly popular, due to their ability to offload data from your local machine to the cloud, service your data to multiple platforms, etc.  


## Learning Objectives

This project aims to help you "ramp up" and get comfortable working with the following tools / technologies / concepts:

* `Python` as a language and a `Flask` as a framework
* [`JSON`](http://www.json.org/) as a means of sending and receiving data
* `HTTP` requests and responses
* Data modeling
* System configuration
* `Python` / `Command-Line-Based` Testing

## Academic Integrity and Collaboration

### Academic Integrity

Note that these projects should be completed **individually**.  As a result, all University-standard AI guidelines should be followed.

### Code Attribution and Collaboration

One of the reasons we chose `Flask` as an initial backend framework for students to use is because of its phenomenal support online.  Looking up framework documentation and adapting the docs' sample code to suite your own needs in something we expect and *want* you to do, as it allows you to explore and increase your self-sufficiency regarding backend development.  However, if you find code in a [`StackOverflow`](`https://stackoverflow.com/`) post or in an open source `Github` repository, then you should cite it accordingly.  See the [project submission](#project-submission) section for guidelines as to where to include those citations.

## System Configuration

Perform the following steps in order:

1. Get [`PyPI`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (`Python Package Index`) - In order to easily download `Python` modules required to run the project, as well as ones that may help you perform certain tasks in the future of the course, `PyPI` is **essential**.  
2. Download [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) - `virtualenv` helps establish an isolated `Python` environment you work in with its own set of `Python` modules it contains within a directory in your project's root.  Once you have `virtualenv`, run the following:

````bash
virtualenv venv
````

This creates a virtual environment called `venv`.  In order to enter than virtual environment, run the following:

````bash
source venv/bin/activate
````

The following command line prompt will indicate that youâ€™re in the virtual environment:

````bash
(venv) >
````

To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following:

````bash
deactivate
````

Whenever you work with this project, you should **always** be in your virtual environment.  Without this isolation, we might run into module versioning issues and other problems when trying to run your project, which creates administrative overhead.  

3. Install dependencies - At the root of directory of the project skeleton code, run the following:

````bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

This installs within your virtual environment all the necessary modules that are required at the beginning of the project.

**NOTE:** The overarching system configuration concepts are explained in more detail in [`this guide`](http://www.joeantonakakis.com/FlaskDevOps/), which we are using as our standard for setting up `Flask` apps in this course.  For information regarding advanced system configuration (which you might need for some of the project extensions, if you tackle them), refer to that guide.
